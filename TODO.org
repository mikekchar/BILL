* TODO

I will try to track stories in here.  Hopefully it will give you
an idea of what BILL is supposed to do and roughly what order it will get
the functionality.

Remember: BILL is a filter that calculates brewing information from an input file,
          prints it to an output file along with prompts for how the user can further
          complete the input.  The file is a ledger that describes a recipe, plan
          and ultimately results of the plan.

** Stories that are done
*** DONE BILL outputs a field for the name of the beer
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Effort: 2
    :Done: 2
    :END
*** DONE Use Cargo to build instead of make
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Effort: 1
    :Done: 1
    :END

** Stories in the backlog
*** TODO BILL Reads its output and echos it
*** TODO BILL writes an error to STDERR if there is input it doesn't recognise
*** TODO BILL Reads its output with details filled in and echos it with the details intact
*** TODO BILL outputs a field for the style
*** TODO BILL allows input of a style db entry and leaves it unchanged
*** TODO If the style matches a style db entry value, BILL outputs guideline values for the recipe
*** TODO Bill allows input of a comment and leaves it unchanged
*** TODO If there is no style listed, BILL adds a list of styles from the style DB in comments
*** TODO If there is a style and there are style comments in the file, BILL removes the style comments
*** TODO BILL allows the style db to be loaded from a second file using a command line parameter
